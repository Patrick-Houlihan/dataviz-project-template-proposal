# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is chess transfers from country to country between 2000 and 2017

## Prototypes

I do not yet have a prototype proof of concept as I'm focusing on prepping the dataset

1. Combining the country codes with country names for easier use (combining two datasets using java program)
2. Expanding dataset to include historical ranking, unknown how I'm going to tackle this one so far.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * What countries represent the highest average ratings of transferring players
 * How can I efficiently get this data from the FIDE ranking website (The tables retain the account ID's and date of transfer, FIDE retains historical ranking at the time)
 * Can I make a timelapse (or time slider) of this data showing where people go from year to year or month to month?
 * What countries show the highest brain drain, of talent leaving and not being replaced?
 * What are the highest rated players to transfer?

## Open Questions

I'm interested in how to calculate the centroids from topoJSON.
I'm nervous about having too much going on in the viz, I think a timelapse would be super cool but it may get too busy.
I'm worried about scraping the FIDE website for historical ratings, I've never done this before.
